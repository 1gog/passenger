Passenger module for Apache2
AKA mod_rails

This is passenger (mod_rails), Debian packaged for the Ubuntu Linux
distribution.

This package version manages the dependencies for you and will install
a fully working Apache2 setup with the module in place and activated.

All you need do is add your virtual host to your setup, and reload
Apache2. See the User Guide (passenger/Users guide.html or
passenger/Users guide.txt.gz) for more information.
