Phusion Passenger is an Nginx module, which makes deploying Ruby and Ruby on
Rails applications on Nginx a breeze. It follows the usual Ruby on Rails
conventions, such as "Don't-Repeat-Yourself" and ease of setup, while at the
same time providing enough flexibility.

This users guide will teach you:

- How to install Nginx with Phusion Passenger support.
- How to configure Phusion Passenger.
- How to deploy a Ruby on Rails application.
- How to deploy a link:http://rack.rubyforge.org/[Rack]-based Ruby application.
- How to solve common problems.

This guide assumes that the reader is somewhat familiar with Nginx and with
using the commandline.


== Supported operating systems ==

Phusion Passenger works on any POSIX-compliant operating system. In other
words: practically any operating system on earth, except Microsoft Windows.

Phusion Passenger for Nginx has been tested on:

- Ubuntu Linux 8.04 (x86)
- Gentoo Linux (AMD64)
- MacOS X Leopard (x86)

Other operating systems have not been tested, but Phusion Passenger will probably
work fine on them. Please
