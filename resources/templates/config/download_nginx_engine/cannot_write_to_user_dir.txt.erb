This program must be able to write to this directory:

  <b><%= @dir %></b>

However, it was unable to do that because of incorrect permissions on that
directory. That directory must be writable to the <b><%= @myself %></b>
user (which this program is running as). Please fix it with the following command:

  <b>sudo chown <%= @myself %> <%= @dir %>
  sudo chmod u+rwx <%= @dir%></b>

After fixing it, please re-run this program.
