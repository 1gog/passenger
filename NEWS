  number of requests processed so far by an app instance, and its current
  uptime
- improved module compatibility + high performance mode
- PassengerEnabled
- SIGQUIT will show backtrace of current thread
- Solaris support for passenger-memory-stats

  must be turned on. Thanks adam.hooper.
- Error pages now return HTTP 500 errors.
- PassengerUseGlobalQueue is now per-virtual host.
- always_restart.txt
- Close the session before mod_xsendfile kicks in, so that the backend
  process is released while mod_xsendfile is working.
- Configurable temp dir.
- Better error messages, more error checking, and other small things
  which makes your live easier.
- Rack is now vendored in order to work around broken applications that
  depend on rack == 0.4.0.
- stat() calls on restart.txt (and always_restart.txt) can now be throttled.
  Configure with PassengerStatThrottleRate. Improves performance on NFS.
- The directory in which Passenger looks for (always_)restart.txt is now
  configurable through PassengerRestartDir.
- PassengerAppRoot
- Does not keep the backend process busy when mod_xsendfile is working.
- Now works correctly with backends that stream data to the browser.
