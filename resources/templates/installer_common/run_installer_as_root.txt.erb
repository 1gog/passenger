This installer must be able to write to the following directory:

  <b><%= @dir %></b>

But it can't do that, because you're running the installer as <b><%= `whoami`.strip %></b>.
Please re-run this installer using <%= @sudo %>:

  <b>export ORIG_PATH="$PATH"
  <%= @sudo_s_e %>
  export PATH="$ORIG_PATH"
  <%= @ruby %> <%= @installer %></b>
