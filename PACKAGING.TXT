Notes for packagers
-------------------
By default Phusion Passenger locates all of its resource files under its
source root directory, however it also supports FHS-complaint packaging.
When packaging Phusion Passenger, be sure to follow these guidelines:

- You can generate a fakeroot with the command 'rake fakeroot'. This will
  generate an FHS-compliant directory tree in pkg/fakeroot, which you can
  directly package or with minor modifications.

  If the default fakeroot structure is not sufficient, please consider
  sending a patch.
- Be sure to set Apache's PassengerRoot directive or Nginx's passenger_root
  directive to /usr. This is a hint to Phusion Passenger that it's packaged
  in an FHS-compliant way.
- Inside the fakeroot you will encounter a directory
  /usr/share/phusion-passenger/source, which contains the entire Phusion
  Passenger source root. This is normal! It's to allow
  passenger-install-nginx-module and Phusion Passenger Lite to work; they
  both require the Phusion Passenger source code in order to compile Nginx.
