# This file defines all supported Apache per-directory configuration options. The
# build system automatically generates the corresponding Apache module boilerplate
# code from the definitions in this file.
# 
# Main configuration options are not defined in this file, but are defined in
# ext/apache2/Configuraion.cpp instead.
# 
# The following boilerplate code is generated:
# 
#  * command_rec array members (ConfigurationCommands.cpp.erb)
# 
# Options:
# 
#  * name - The configuration option name. Required.
#  * context - The context in which this configuration option is valid.
#              Defaults to ["OR_OPTIONS", "ACCESS_CONF", "RSRC_CONF"]
#  * type - This configuration option's value type. Allowed types:
#           :string, :integer, :flag
#  * min_value - If `type` is :integer, then this specifies the minimum
#                allowed value. When nil (the default), there is no minimum.
#  * desc - A description for this configuration option. Required.
